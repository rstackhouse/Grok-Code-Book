The solitary nature of much of computer programming and the number of different avenues that may lead to a career in programming make it 
difficult for best practices to permiate the field. A responsible author can no longer assume that a person seeking to learn about programming 
has any background in either computer science or mathematics. All jargon should be introduced in a glossary at minimum; regardless of how many 
works the author has authored. If a programming text is to build on some assumed knowledge, it must explicitly define said knowledge from the 
outset, and ought contain a ``Read First'' section. 

Also, the volume of information forthcoming about new technologies---frameworks, toolkits, tooling, etc.---drowns out information about programming 
well. By providing this text free of charge, holding ourselves to the highest standard of authorship and editorship, trying to make this text 
accessible to all that might read it, and acting as stewards and care-takers of this living document, we hope to raise the bar for published 
works pertaining to computer programming.

The examples included hereafter are executed in \CSharp and Microsoft.Net, but the concepts set forth therein are relevant to all OO languages and frameworks.
